#TODO -> Improve this READ ME

This is a project for running a local llm that uses retrieval augmentation (RAG) to generate answers based on context which is fed to it via PDFs.
The project was done for the chair "Soziotechnisches Systemdesign und KÃ¼nstliche Intelligenz" (SSKI) at Ruhr-University Bochum.
