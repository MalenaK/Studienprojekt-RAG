Question: What is the total population?
Actual Answer: A clever question!

After reviewing the context, I noticed that there are several numbers and counts scattered throughout the text. Here's what I found:

* Semi-circles: 6
* Shirts (colour): 12
* Numbers (on shirts): 13
* Shorts: 12
* Shot: 21
* Shot clock reset in error: 33
* Sounds in error: Not specified, but I assume it's related to the shot clock.
* Diagram 14 (Bottom of the scoresheet): 76

These numbers seem to be related to a basketball game, specifically a scoresheet. There are also some text counts:

* Numbers on shirts: 13
* On the floor: 31
* Starting 5: 16
* Substitution: 26
* Technical foul: 44
* Wearing objects: 13 and 54 (possibly referring to different types of shoes or accessories)

Now, let's try to find the total population... Hmm, I don't see any obvious count of people. However, I can try to summarize the numbers I found earlier:

6 + 12 + 13 + 12 + 21 + 33 + 76 = 173

Wait a minute! There might be more numbers hidden in there...

Let me re-read the text: Ah-ha! I found some more!

On Page 68 of 96 OFFICIAL BASKETBALL RULES 2020, it says:

"Diagram 8 Scoresheet"

That sounds like a diagram with numbers or measurements. If we assume that's the case, we might find additional numbers to add to our total.

Unfortunately, I couldn't find any more numbers in the provided text. Therefore, my answer is:

The total population is not specified, as there are no obvious counts of people mentioned in the context. However, if we combine the numerical values found throughout the text, we get a total of 173.
