Question: What kind of retrievers can be used in RA-LLMs?
Answer: According to the provided context, one type of retriever that can be used in RA-LLMs is a dense retriever. Specifically, it mentions that "Another stream of dense retrievers having been widely applied in RA-LLMs uses one encoder only, which may be based on Transformer, BERT or other off-the-shelf sequence modeling backbones." 

Additionally, the context also mentions general-purpose pre-trained retrievers, such as Contriever [42] and Spider [118], which can be used in RA-LLMs targeting various tasks.

Question: Once my data is stored in the RA-LLM system, in what format will it be retrieved from the database?
Answer: Based on the provided context, once your data is stored in the RA-LLM (Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model) system, it can be retrieved from the database in various formats depending on the specific design of the retriever.

The context mentions that the retrieval process involves several procedures functioning as a whole to measure the relevance between the query and documents in the database. The key component, retriever, consists of several operations including chunking/tokenizing/indexing, dense/sparse retrieval, embedding, and relevance scoring.

In Figure 4, it is shown that the retrieved documents can be in different formats such as chunks/documents/tokens/entities, etc.

Therefore, once your data is stored in the RA-LLM system, it will be retrieved from the database in a format determined by the specific design of the retriever. This could include whole pieces of documents or specific tokens/chunks of information.

Question: I am having problems setting up my RAG system. Right now, the chunks retrieved by the retriever donâ€™t really seem to match my query. What could I do to get more relevant chunks from the retriever?
Answer: Based on the provided context, it seems that you are experiencing issues with the retrieval process in your RAG system, where the retrieved chunks are not matching well with your query. To improve the relevance of the retrieved chunks, I would suggest the following:

1. **Retrieval granularity**: You may want to consider using a different retrieval granularity, such as token retrieval [62] or entity retrieval [39], instead of chunk retrieval. Token retrieval can be more suitable for cases requiring rare patterns or out-of-domain data.
2. **Retriever type**: Ensure that you are using the correct retriever type. The context mentions sparse and dense retrieval methods, which can affect the relevance of the retrieved chunks.
3. **Pre- and post-retrieval enhancement**: Consider applying pre- and post-retrieval enhancements to fine-tune the retrieval process. This may include techniques such as filtering or ranking the retrieved results based on their relevance to the query [117].
4. **Database construction**: Verify that your database is constructed correctly, with key-value pairs for knowledge stored in a way that allows for efficient similarity matching (e.g., sparse vectors like BM25 or dense embeddings from retrieval encoding).
5. **Retrieval frequency**: You may need to adjust the retrieval frequency to balance computing cost and performance. More frequent retrieval can lead to better performance but also increases the computing cost [117].

By addressing these potential issues, you may be able to improve the relevance of the retrieved chunks and enhance the overall performance of your RAG system.

Question: What ways are there to incorporate knowledge directly from the Internet into my RAG/RA-LLM system? For my RAG system, I would like to use a less common way of integrating the retrieved external knowledge into my generation model. Are there any approaches to use the knowledge not as part of the initial input for my generation model?
Answer: According to the provided context, there are several ways to incorporate knowledge directly from the Internet into your RAG/RA-LLM system.

One common approach is to use Internet search as a retriever in RA-LLMs. This method provides high-quality ranking after being tuned over decades of use and can be effective for different functions such as knowledge augmentation, fact-checking, and LLM agent enhancement [70]. Existing studies have shown that leveraging search engines (e.g., InstrucGPT) is particularly effective for LLMs on zero-shot knowledge-intensive tasks such as OpenQA and fact checking [182].

Another way to incorporate Internet knowledge is through post-retrieval enhancement. This approach involves retrieving relevant documents from external databases and using them as context to enhance the generation process [54]. However, it's also important to consider that the retrieved information may sometimes be irrelevant or contain noise, which might not help with the generation model for the task, or even worse, harm the generation process [159].

A less common way of integrating retrieved external knowledge into your generation model is through post-retrieval enhancement strategies. For example, Wang et al. [155] propose BlendFilter, which simultaneously considers pre-retrieval query generation blending and post-retrieval knowledge filtering. This method can tackle complex questions as well as noisy retrieved knowledge problems, thereby comprehensively enhancing the RA-LLM performance.

In addition to these approaches, there are also advanced RAG pipelines that have been proposed using LLMs to generate reasoning paths and plans with the Information Retrieval (IR) module to iteratively retrieve knowledge to enhance LLM-based generation [130, 172, 175].

These approaches can be used as supplementary information or as prompts for your RAG/RA-LLM system.

Question: What is the difference between Input-Layer-Integration as a design for generation augmentation and prompt-engineering based methods for training-free RA-LLMs?
Answer: According to the context, Input-Layer Integration in generation-based RAG (Reinforcement Augmentation Generation) methods is different from prompt-engineering based methods for training-free RA-LLMs.

In traditional RAGs, input-layer integration uses the retrieved content as supplementary information on top of the original input. In contrast, prompt-engineering based methods use the retrieved content as additional prompts or demonstrations to teach the Language Model (LM) to learn in context or induce it to reason. This approach may boost the zero-shot ability of LLMs without delicate prompt engineering.

In other words, input-layer integration focuses on integrating the retrieved information with the original input at the input layer, whereas prompt-engineering based methods focus on using the retrieved content as additional guidance for the LM to generate text.

Question: To improve my RAG system capabilities, I would like to train both the retriever and the generator. What can you tell me about the approaches there and when to use the approaches?
Answer: Based on the context, training both the retriever and the generator is a sequential process that can be categorized into two classes: Retriever First and LLMs First.

Retriever First methods first train the retrieval model and then fix it. The Large Language Models (LLMs) are then trained by utilizing the retrieved knowledge. For instance, RETRO [6] adopts the BERT model that is pre-trained independently as the retriever, and an encoder-decoder architecture is trained to integrate retrieval chunks into the model's predictions [4.3.1 Retriever First].

LLMs First methods first train the LLMs and then fix them. The retriever is then trained by utilizing the knowledge from the fixed LLMs.

To determine which approach to use, consider the training order between the retriever and generator. If you want to fine-tune the retrieval model and guide the large language models to effectively adapt and integrate retrieved information, Retriever First might be a better choice [127, 128, 130, 135, 153, 199].

On the other hand, if you want to utilize the knowledge from pre-trained LLMs and adapt them for specific downstream tasks, LLMs First might be more suitable.

Question:  I am building a simple webshop. As it is common nowadays, I would like my webshop to recommend similar products to my customers based on what they are currently looking at or have recently bought. Are there any existing RAG-systems that could help me with that?
Answer: Based on the provided context, it appears that RA-LLMs (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) have demonstrated great potential in providing personalized and contextually relevant recommendations by integrating retrieval and generation processes.

For your webshop, you can leverage this technology to recommend similar products to customers based on what they are currently looking at or have recently bought. Specifically:

1. **Di Palma's Retrieval-Augmented Recommendation Model**: This model leverages knowledge from movie or book datasets to enhance recommendations. You can adapt this approach for your webshop by retrieving relevant product information from external sources (e.g., product descriptions, customer reviews) and using it to generate personalized recommendations.

2. **Lu et al.'s work on enriching item information in recommender systems**: This study further retrieves information from reviews to enhance item information in recommender systems. You can apply this approach by collecting customer reviews for the products your customers are interested in or have purchased, and then using this information to generate recommendations.

To implement these RAG-systems, you may need to:

* Integrate retrieval and generation processes
* Leverage external knowledge sources (e.g., product descriptions, customer reviews)
* Train a retriever component to measure the relevance between user queries and product information

The provided context does not specify existing RAG-systems for recommendation tasks. However, recent studies have demonstrated the great potential of RAG techniques in various generation tasks with simple adaptation of the retrieval component.
