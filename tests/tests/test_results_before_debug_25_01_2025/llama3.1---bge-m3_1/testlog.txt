Question: What is charging?
Actual Answer: Based on the provided context from TM 9-759, section "35. GENERATOR", it appears that charging refers to the process of generating electrical power for the vehicle's systems.

From page 52 of the document (..\data\data_basic\m4a3.pdf:52:0), it is stated:

"a. Description. A special Ford tank generator model GAA is used. The generator is 30 volt, 50 ampere capacity and current control is obtained by a generator regulator mounted underneath floor of turret..."

This suggests that the charging system is responsible for generating 30-volt power at a capacity of 50 amperes.

Additionally, from page 52 (..\data\data_basic\m4a3.pdf:52:0), it is mentioned:

"b. Lubrication. Generators are properly lubricated at engine overhaul periods and should not require additional lubrication between overhaul periods."

This implies that the generator, which is responsible for charging the vehicle's electrical systems, requires periodic lubrication to function properly.

Therefore, based on this information, charging likely refers to the process of generating electrical power for the vehicle using the generator system.

Question: Is the spark control automatic?
Actual Answer: According to the context, no, the spark control is not fully automatic. 

The text mentions that there are two 4-cylinder Bosch magnetos which are controlled by a 4-position switch in the center of the instrument panel at the top (TM 9-759, page 6). This indicates that the ignition system has multiple settings for different engine configurations.

When the ignition switch lever is at the position marked "L", only the left-hand magneto is on, and the engine will run on the left-hand four cylinders. Similarly, when the switch lever is at the position marked "R", only the right-hand magneto is on, and the engine will run on the four cylinders on the right-hand bank.

This means that the driver has to manually adjust the ignition switch to select which set of spark plugs will be energized.
