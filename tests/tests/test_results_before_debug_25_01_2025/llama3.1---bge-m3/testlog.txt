Question: Is the spark control automatic?
Actual Answer: No, the spark control is not fully automatic. The information from TM 9-759 (block with source ..\data\data_basic\m4a3.pdf:47:0) describes the procedure for removing and installing the fuel pump, but it does not mention a specific mechanism for controlling the spark plug gaps or breaker points.

However, the information in block 2 states that the "Make and model...-—— ——————————— Bosch MJF-4A308" magneto has a breaker point gap of 0.014-in.-0.016-in. and a spark plug gap of 0.011-in.-0.014-in.

This suggests that the ignition system is mechanically controlled, with manual adjustment of the breaker points and spark plugs required to maintain proper timing and performance.

Additionally, the information in block 5 states that "The Ford tank engine uses two 4-cylinder Bosch magnetos which are controlled by a 4-position switch in the center of the instrument panel at the top." This implies that there is some level of manual control over the ignition system, but it does not specify whether the spark control is fully automatic or not.

Therefore, I conclude that the spark control is not fully automatic, and requires some degree of manual adjustment.

The switch has four positions: both magnetos on, left-hand magneto only, right-hand magneto only, and the ignition switch is also described as having positions "L" and "R", which indicate control over specific cylinders or cylinder banks. This suggests that the driver must manually select which magneto to use.
