range from 16 to 32 volts is provided. When the battery master 
switch is off, the voltmeter will read at the lower end of the scale. 
When the master switch is "on," the voltmeter should read battery 
voltage (approximately 24 volts). If reading is low with the engine 
not running and no electrical energy is being used, the batteries are 
low in charge and should be recharged. At normal operating speeds 
during normal ambient temperatures, the voltage should not exceed 
30 volts. If the reading is greater than this, the generator regulator 
is not properly limiting the voltage, and should be replaced; other 
wise the generator will burn out. This voltmeter likewise reads while 
the auxiliary generating unit is charging the battery, at which time 
the voltage should not exceed 30 volts.
