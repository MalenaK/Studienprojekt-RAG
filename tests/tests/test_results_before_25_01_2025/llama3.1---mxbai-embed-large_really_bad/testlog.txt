Question: How can a defensive player establish a legal guarding position?
Actual Answer: According to the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2020, a defensive player can establish a legal guarding position by:

• Facing his opponent (Page 38 of 96, ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:38:1)
• Having both feet on the floor (Page 38 of 96, ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:38:1)

Additionally, when guarding a player with the ball, the defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position without causing contact before taking his position (Page 39 of 96, ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:39:0).

It's also worth noting that when moving to maintain the initial legal guarding position, one foot or both feet may be off the floor for an instant, as long as the movement is lateral or backwards, but not towards the player with the ball (Page 39 of 96, ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:39:0).

Question: How long does a timeout last?
Actual Answer: According to the provided context, Article 18, Time-out (pages 24 and 25 of FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2020), a time-out is defined as an interruption of the game requested by the head coach or first assistant coach.

E.2.1 In each quarter 1 Media time -out is permitted, in addition to the regular team time-outs. Media time-outs in an overtime are not permitted.  
E.2.2 The first time-out in each quarter (team or Media) shall be 60, 75, 90 or 100 seconds in duration.  
E.2.3 The duration of all other time-outs in a quarter shall be 60 seconds.

However, Article 18 specifically states that:

Question: How many players are allowed for each team on the play court?
Actual Answer: According to the provided context, page 12 of 96 OFFICIAL BASKETBALL RULES 2020:

"A team member is eligible to play when he has been authorised to play for a team according to the regulations, including regulations governing age limits, of the organising body of the competition. 
4.1.2 A team member is entitled to play when his name has been entered on the scoresheet before the beginning of the game and as long as he has neither been disqualified nor committed 5 fouls. 
4.1.3 During playing time, a team member is: 
• A player when he is on the playing court and is entitled to play.
• A substitute when he is not on the playing court but he is entitled to play.

Since there are no further restrictions mentioned for the number of players allowed on the playing court, it can be inferred that a team is allowed to have all 12 eligible team members on the playing court at any given time, as long as they are entitled to play and none have been disqualified or committed 5 fouls.

Question: What is charging?
Actual Answer: According to the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2020 (page 41 of 96), charging occurs when a defensive player's arm(s) or elbow(s) are outside their cylinder while taking position on the floor, and they make contact with an opponent who is attempting to pass by. This is considered blocking or holding.

Additionally, according to Rule 33.10 (page 41 of 96), no-charge semi-circle areas are designated for interpreting charge/block situations under the basket. On any penetration play into this area, if a defensive player has one foot or both feet in contact with it, and an airborne offensive player makes contact with them, it shall not be called as an offensive foul unless the offensive player is illegally using their hands, arms, legs, or body.

	* The defensive player must face their opponent and have both feet on the floor.
	* They may raise their arms and hands above their head or jump vertically, but they must maintain them in a vertical position inside an imaginary cylinder extending from the floor to the ceiling.
2. Guarding a player who does not control the ball (33.5):
	* The defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position without causing contact before taking their position.
	* They may take a position so near and/or so quickly in the path of a moving opponent that the latter has sufficient time or distance to stop or change direction, provided they do not cause contact.

Additionally, according to section 33.6, when a defensive player is already in a legal guarding position, they may turn within their cylinder to avoid injury.
