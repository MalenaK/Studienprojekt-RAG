Question: How to stop the engine?
Actual Answer: To stop the engine, follow these steps:

2. Pull back on both steering levers at the same time (TM 9-759, page 10).

Depressing the clutch pedal and setting the hand throttle to a tachometer reading of 500 rpm for the duration of the halt are also mentioned in TM 9-759, page 10.

Additionally, when stopping the engine, it is recommended to pull the toggle switch (located next to the ignition) to the right and hold it in that position until the engine stops (TM 4A3.pdf, page 18). This shuts off the fuel from the idle fuel supply wells in the carburetor, which will prevent loading up of the carburetor if the engine is restarted while still hot.
