Question: Is the spark control automatic?
Actual Answer: The spark control on the Ford tank engine is not entirely automatic. It can be controlled manually using a 4-position switch on the instrument panel, which controls two Bosch magnetos. 

According to the information, when the ignition switch lever is at the position marked "R", the right-hand magneto is on and the engine will run on the four cylinders on the right-hand bank only. This indicates that the spark control can be selectively switched between different banks of cylinders.

However, there is no indication that the spark control system automatically adjusts to optimize performance or compensates for any issues with cylinder lubrication due to excessive priming (as mentioned in block 7).

This legal guarding position extends vertically above him (cylinder) from the floor to the ceiling, and he may raise his arms and hands above his head or jump vertically but must maintain them in a vertical position inside the imaginary cylinder.
