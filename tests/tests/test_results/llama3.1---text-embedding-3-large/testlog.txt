Question: May a team substitute a player?
Actual Answer: According to the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2020, a substitution is an interruption of the game requested by the substitute to become a player (Art. 19  Substitution, 19.1 Definition). A team may substitute a player(s) during a substitution opportunity, which begins under certain conditions such as when the ball becomes dead and the game clock is stopped, or after a successful last free throw (Art. 19  Substitution, 19.2 Rule).

The procedure for requesting a substitution involves only the substitute going to the scorer's table and asking clearly for a substitution, making the proper conventional sign with their hands (Art. 19  Substitution, 19.3.1). The timer shall sound his signal to notify the referees that a request for a substitution has been made, after which the referee blows his whistle, gives the substitution signal, and beckons the substitute to enter the playing court.

It is worth noting that if the team is reduced to fewer than 5 players on the playing court, a substitution shall not be permitted (Art. 19  Substitution, 19.2.4), unless in specific cases such as when a player entitled to free-throws is on the bench after having been legally substituted.

Question: What is charging?
Actual Answer: According to the provided context, there are multiple mentions of "charging" but I will provide an answer based on each relevant source:

1. In the context of basketball rules:
   Charging refers to a type of foul in basketball. The exact definition and illustration can be found in FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:65:0, where it is described as "ILLEGAL CONTACT TO THE HAND" with examples of illegal contact.

2. In the context of M4A3 tank maintenance:
   Charging refers to charging a battery. For example, on page 40 of m4a3.pdf, it mentions "Battery Charging" and provides guidance on how to check the specific gravity of batteries and ensure they are fully charged.

So, in general, charging can refer to either a foul in basketball or the process of recharging a battery in the context of tank maintenance.

Question: What is charging?
Actual Answer: Charging, as a concept, has multiple meanings depending on the context. However, based on the provided blocks of text:

From the basketball rules (Source: FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:65:0), it appears that "charging" refers to a type of foul in basketball. Specifically, it involves illegal contact with an opponent while charging at the basket or attempting to gain position for a shot.

In the context of the M4A3 tank manual (Source: m4a3.pdf:40:0 and 56:0), "charging" seems to refer to the act of recharging or replenishing batteries. It is mentioned in sections related to battery maintenance, where it is advised to replace a discharged battery with a fully charged one, check for corrosion on terminals, and ensure proper connections.

So, without more specific context, it's difficult to provide a definitive answer. However, if you're referring to the basketball rules or the tank manual, charging might be described as follows:

- In basketball: illegal contact while attempting to gain position at the basket
- In the M4A3 tank manual: recharging or replenishing batteries
