Actual Answer: According to the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2020 (..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf, page 38), a defensive player can establish an initial legal guarding position in two situations:

1. When guarding a player who controls the ball: The defensive player must face his opponent and have both feet on the floor.
2. When guarding a player who does not control the ball (and applying the elements of time and distance): The defensive player cannot take a position so near and/or so quickly in the path of a moving opponent that the latter does not have sufficient time or distance either to stop or change his direction.

Additionally, when establishing an initial legal guarding position, the defensive player must do so without causing contact with their opponent.
