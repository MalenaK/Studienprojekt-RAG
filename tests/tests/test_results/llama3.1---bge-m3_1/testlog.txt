Question: How can a defensive player establish a legal guarding position?
Actual Answer: According to the provided context, a defensive player can establish an initial legal guarding position by:

• Facing his opponent, and
• Having both feet on the floor.

This establishes a vertical cylinder from the floor to the ceiling around the defensive player. The defensive player may then raise their arms and hands above their head or jump vertically, but must maintain them in a vertical position inside the imaginary cylinder (Source: ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:38:1).

Once an initial legal guarding position is established, the defensive player may move to guard their opponent, as long as they do not extend their arms, shoulders, hips, or legs to prevent the ball handler from passing by (Source: ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:39:0).

Additionally, when guarding a player who controls the ball, the defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position without causing contact before taking their position (Source: ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:38:1).
Expected Answer: Face his opponent and have both feet on the floor

Test Case Number: 8
Question: How many minutes does a quarter have?
Actual Answer: The rules do not explicitly state the duration of a quarter, but it can be inferred from other parts of the rules.

According to section 9.2, "All other quarters or overtimes begin when the ball is at the disposal of the player taking the throw-in." This implies that each quarter has a specific duration, and overtime periods also have a duration (5 minutes, as mentioned in section 8.7).

However, the exact duration of a regular quarter is not explicitly stated.

According to section E.3.1 (source: ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:86:0), "Ideally, the Media time-out shall be taken before the 5:00 minutes remaining in the quarter". This suggests that a regular quarter has at least 40 minutes (5 minutes + 35 minutes, assuming 2 minutes for the media timeout).

A more specific answer can be found in section B.7.1 (source: ..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:70:1), which states that "Time-outs granted shall be entered on the scoresheet by entering the minute of the playing time of the quarter or overtime in the appropriate boxes below the team's name." This implies that a regular quarter has 48 minutes (4 quarters x 12 minutes per quarter is not mentioned, but if we consider 4 quarters, it would be 24 minutes per quarter; however, considering this might be related to other periods like half-time and overtime, it seems to match the 40 minutes previously inferred from section E.3.1).

Please note that there are some uncertainties in the rules regarding the exact duration of a regular quarter.
