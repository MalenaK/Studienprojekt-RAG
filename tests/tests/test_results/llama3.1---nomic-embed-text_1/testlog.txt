Question: How can a defensive player establish a legal guarding position?
Actual Answer: According to the FIBA Official Basketball Rules 2020 (..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:38:1, :39:0), a defensive player has established an initial legal guarding position when:

* He is facing his opponent, and
* He has both feet on the floor.

Additionally, the legal guarding position extends vertically above him (cylinder) from the floor to the ceiling, and he may raise his arms and hands above his head or jump vertically but must maintain them in a vertical position inside the imaginary cylinder. 

Please note that when guarding a player who controls the ball, time and distance do not apply, and the defensive player must establish an initial legal guarding position without causing contact before taking his position (..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:38:1).

When moving to maintain the initial legal guarding position, one foot or both feet may be off the floor for an instant, as long as the movement is lateral or backwards, but not towards the player with the ball (..\data\data_basic\FIBAOfficialBasketballRules2020_v1.0.pdf:39:0).
