Question: What is the weight without armament, fuel or crew?
Actual Answer: According to TM 9-759, Section II, DESCRIPTION AND TABULATED DATA, under "Weight of vehicle" (Page 3), it states:

However, the question asks for the weight without armament, fuel or crew. According to the same section, the weight of the engine is 1470 lb, and there is no mention of fuel or crew in the provided context.
